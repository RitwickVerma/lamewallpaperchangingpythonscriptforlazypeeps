### What the fook is this?

This script downloads a wallpaper of your screen resolution from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and sets it as your wallpaper. It'll save the downloaded image in the folder of this script. The script waits for the internet till eternity if your net's like mine (not working/ too slow to notice it's working). Oh yes, there's a notification too (not in Windows. Windows is shit).  
#### Few things to remember:
* Now it actually works. I think.
* Only for linux and windows.
* Needs python2 and tkinter
* Tested on GNOME de only. I don't think it works elsewhere. In the future maybe?
* Doesn't work with python3. In the future maybe?.
* If it's not working, it's okay. It's lame anyway. Just download wallpaper yourself you lazy PoS.
* Stop hate crime against asian midget grannies. I'm strictly against it #asianmidgetgrannielivesmatter  

#### Working ok
