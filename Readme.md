### What the fook is this?

This script downloads a wallpaper of your screen resolution from [Unsplash](www.unpslash.com) and sets it as your wallpaper. It'll save the downloaded image in pictures folder. You can also select if you wanna play a random song from your music folder in the default music player. The script waits for the internet till eternity if your net's like mine (not working). Oh yes, theres a notification too.  
#### Few things to remember:
* Only for **linux**
* Needs python2 and tkinter
* Tested on GNOME, Pantheon. Might not work on Unity.
* Doesn't work with python3. Maybe I update it in the future so that it does (no I won't, I got no chill)
* If it's not working, it's okay. It's lame anyway. Just download wallpaper yourself you lazy PoS.
* Stop hate crime againt asian midget grannies. I'm strictly against it.  

#### Working ok
